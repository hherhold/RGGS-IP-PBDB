# RGGS-IP-PBDB

This is a Jupyter notebook for gathering PBDB occurrence data for the Spring 2021 AMNH RGGS Invertebrate Paleontology class.

You will need to start Jupyter using either

`jupyter lab`  (preferred)

or

`jupyter notebook` (also ok).

You may need to install jupyer lab using conda with

`conda install jupyterlab`

Then load the notebook `PBDB Occurrences.ipynb` and follow along.

You will need to determine your own formation name and tweak it in the code, and you will also need to
determine your own URL for downloading data. This is largely meant to be a starting point for anyone
interested to tweak it as needed for their own stuff.

You can also use Visual Studio Code if so inclined (I kinda like it, so far).

Happy to answer any questions.
